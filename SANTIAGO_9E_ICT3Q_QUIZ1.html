A cursed captain and his ghost crew are trying to escape from the cursed world they inhabit. Jack Sparrow, a rogue and cunning pirate, agrees to give them their freedom in exchange for a map leading to the heart of Blackbeard's ship, which they need to lift their curse. It's a tale of adventure, deception, and betrayal, all set against the backdrop of the Caribbean seas.</td>

        <td>"Moving at a breezy pace throughout it's 2-hour-and-20-minute-long running time, this swashbuckling action diversion kept me riveted and in awe from start to finish with Gore Verbinski's astonishing direction, alongside the seamless craftsmanship via striking cinematographic tricks, and a taut plot, starting with a pleasing plotline for Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner in a gripping opening scene. Not to mention that I can see that it's even worth revisiting on repeat viewings. Based on my experience, "The Curse of the Black Pearl" defines itself as the kind of movie that delivers what anybody desires: a fun swashbuckling adventure romp that is thrilling, horrifying, harrowing, and hilarious with rip-roaring action, an engrossing story to tell, and excellent theatrical performances by a perfect cast. Not only that "The Curse of the Black Pearl" is utterly exciting, yet deep down, it is also intelligent; it unfolds intriguing exposition, especially about the unholy curse. Not to mention that it contains a deeper meaning about stereotyping, because not all pirates are bad." <br> <span style="color: yellow;"> 9/10 </span></td>

The crew of the Black Pearl, led by the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow, is looking for a way to lift their curse, but their mission is complicated by the return of their old nemesis, Hector Barbossa, now allied with a rogue sea monster and a mysterious and powerful artifact called the Chest of Isla de Muerta. It's a tale of danger, adventure, and betrayal, all set against the backdrop of the Caribbean seas and the secret realm of Davy Jones' Locker.</td>

It looks visually fantastic right down to the locations and costumes and the CGI still holds up mostly but the stunts scenes go on for too long and make little sense.  It's not bad, it's still fun, just wish it was shorter." <br> <span style="color: yellow;"> 6/10 </span></td>

        <td>"This is one the best Pirates movie out of the five released. High recommend watching this movie if you have watched the previous two movies since the plot may be a little difficult to understand but this was basically Endgame before Endgame. It brought a close to most of our character's story arcs and journeys. It had the right amount of emotion and humor. The plot has really high stakes as the fate of all the pirates are at stake which keeps you on the edge of your seat. The maelstrom battle is everything we could have hoped for with the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman going head to head. Not to mention the beautiful score written by Hans Zimmer truly make you feel the raw emotion of the story. Truly a spectacular work of art." <br> <span style="color: yellow;"> 10/10 </span> </td>
